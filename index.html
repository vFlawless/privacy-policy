        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The web history data collected (specifically fishing-related URLs) is used to save fishing stats related to each of the URLs. The website content modification is used to enhance the user experience on certain sites.</p>

        <h2>Where Your Data Is Stored</h2>
